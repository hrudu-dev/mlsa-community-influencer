# Technical Training Guide

## What is Technical Training?
Technical Training is a required learning path for Student Ambassadors. It covers AI, Azure, and business concepts, and runs quarterly on Microsoft Learn.

## How to Complete
- Start the plan yourself (not auto-enrolled).
- Use the same Learn username/email as registration.
- Finish all modules and exercises by the quarter’s end.

## Tips
- Progress carries over if you don’t finish in time.
- If you don’t get a completion email, check your Learn username format (see [README](../README.md)).
- If you can’t access Azure for Students, use the Azure Free offer instead.
